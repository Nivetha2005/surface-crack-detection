# Surface Crack Detection 🧱📷

This project focuses on detecting surface cracks in concrete using deep learning. We used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as either "Crack" or "No Crack" with high accuracy.

## 📂 Dataset
- 40,000 images (20k with cracks, 20k without)
- Image size: 227x227 pixels, RGB
- Original images: High-res 4032x3024, collected and processed by Zhang et al. (2016)

## 🧠 Model
- Built using TensorFlow and Keras
- Achieved **>99% accuracy** with EarlyStopping
- Binary classification using CNN
- Visualizations with Seaborn, Plotly, and Matplotlib

## 📊 Evaluation
- Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, F1-Score
- Visualization of correct and incorrect predictions
- Model performance improves with each epoch

## 📁 Files
- `Surface_Crack_Detection.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with code
- `Surface_Crack_Detection_Report.pdf` – Full project report with explanation

## 👩‍💻 Team
- Nivetha T
